To run this app you need to have node installed on your machine. If you don't have it you can download the installer from https://nodejs.org/en/. 

Once node is available, open a terminal and cd into the app folder. type in 'npm start' and a server will start up on port 3000. Then just go into the web browser and type in '127.0.0.1:3000'. After that the website is fully available to play around this.
